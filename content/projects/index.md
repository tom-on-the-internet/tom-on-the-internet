## Cemetery Escape

Cemetery Escape is terminal-based game. I wrote a [blog post](/cemetery-escape/) about it. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/tom-on-the-internet/cemetery-escape).

## YouTube Channel

I have a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2NXVB__-v-hf-l6wcg1zjQ) where I make videos about programming.
