Hi. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me.

I'm a senior, fullstack web software developer living in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada (about an hour from Toronto).

I work across the stack in frontend, backend and infrastructure. I have experience leading developers, working solo, collaborating across teams... you name it.

I deliver projects quickly without compromising on quality.

I grew up in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. It was a good place to grow up, but it was cold.

I have a Masters of Education. For a decade I taught English at the college level in South Korea and Canada. In my 30s I taught myself software development and this was one of the best decisions of my life.

I now live in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada where I work from home. I'm living the dream.
