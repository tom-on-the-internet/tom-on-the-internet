## Professional

I'm a senior, fullstack programmer living in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. I work primarily with the web. I work on anything from html and css, to PHP and Go, to Bash scripts and Terraform.

I have experience leading developers, working solo, collaborating across teams... you name it.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. My email address is <a href="mailto:tom@tomontheinternet.com">tom@tomontheinternet.com</a>.

## Personal

I was born ~40 years ago. I grew up in Northern Ontario. It was a good place to grow up, but it was cold.

I've lived in West Africa, South Korea, and North York. Now I live in a nice house, with my nice family, in St. Catharines.

For a decade I was an English teacher. I **didn't** like being an English teacher. Then I taught myself software development. This was one of the best choices of my life.

I'm interested in people; who they are and how they think. I'm interested in computers, languages, computer languages and a few other things, too.

I can speak Korean, a little bit. 한국어를 할 수 있습니까?
