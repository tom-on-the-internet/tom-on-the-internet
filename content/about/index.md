## wow

I'm a programmer, father, husband... look, I'll be honest. I find writing about myself pretty difficult. You ever try to look inside and not find anything?

I was born ~40 years ago. I grew up in Northern Ontario. It was a good place to grow up, but it was cold.

I've lived in West Africa, South Korea, and North York. Now I live in a nice house, with my nice family, in St. Catharines.

For a decade I was an English teacher. I **didn't** like being an English teacher. Then I taught myself software development. This was one of the best choices of my life.

I'm interested in people; who they are and how they think. I'm interested in computers, languages, computer languages and a few other things, too.

I can speak Korean, a little bit. 한국어를 할 수 있습니까?

I try hard.
